Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at Sichuan University, and my major subject is computer science. Artificial intelligence is the frontier subject with the most potential to change the world, and deep learning is the most promising research direction. Learning and applying deep learning is promising way for us computer science students to become successful. But my university didn't offer a great deep learning program, so I want to learn them on the Coursera. Last weekend, I have studied the first course in the series of deep learning courses, which created by the deeplearning.ai, by the Coursera providing the free course for every student a year.So, I really appreciate Coursera could be friendly to student, and I already learned the first course, and I want to learn them one by one. I believe the god help who help themselves, and I also trust that learning at Coursera will change my life.Hope you can pass the application. Thank you very much.
